With this, Adams endorsed his intention to turn New York into one of the centers of the crypto market; as well as other highly developed technological industries.<br/>  Thanks to the multiple applications of this technology, as well as the benefits it offers, DISR arises as a response to people's interest in entering this market through a solid project with an ever-increasing growth."

                        content:'According to the definition provided by Coinbase, a "token" has a very wide range of potential functions: from helping to enable decentralized exchanges, to selling or collecting foreign objects both in gaming and in the various marketplaces that have emerged. <br/> In addition, tokens can be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency. And it is mainly these features that make tokens very interesting assets for investors, as well as for various professionals, celebrities or public in general.<br/> Nowadays, most tokens operate on the Ethereum blockchain protocol (according to experts, it is much more complete than the Bitcoin blockchain). However, many people still have fears or reservations about not fully understanding this technological innovation or the technical language.<br/> That’s why, DISR has created a distribution model that allows and encourages the participation of all members to form a community to debate, propose and agree on changes within the protocol in general.

Since then, technology companies and software or entertainment developers (just to mention different fields) have begun to look for new ways to get closer to the public and users. <br/>   This has allowed a company like META; among others, to start designing, developing and offering immersive technology. And working closely with blockchain technology; as well as cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. <br/> An example of this are the fan tokens in the field of sports.<br/> During June 2020, the world-renowned sports club FC Barcelona launched its own token and managed to sell out in two hours, which brought in €1.2 million in revenue. <br/> But that's just one example. Instagram, one of the largest social networks used worldwide, will soon integrate an option for users to show and share their NFT's and their authenticity.<br/>  All this, with the purpose of making all these technological developments much more 'accessible and closer to the users', as detailed by Adam Mosseri, CEO of Instagram. <br/> <h4>But what is the lesson from all this?</h4> With the demise of various forms of face-to-face trading, and the technological revolution over the past five years, blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and the various applications of tokens have already generated $20 million in revenue. <br/>And analysts claim that this is just the beginning.",

Thanks to its structure, the four aspects that integrate its risk control, as well as a total supply that operates and is nurtured by a comprehensive ecosystem of participation, it automatically becomes a project with an unstoppable growth opportunity. <br/>DISR Coin has the technology to go further. Every detail of its design, production and applications has been taken care of from the beginning by a team of collaborators and professional experts in their field. The foundations have been built. Now it only remains to continue working to provide the user not just another token, but a whole experience. <br/> The possibility of participating in the transformation of the world, as we know it, to live in an intelligent reality. <br/>A DISR Coin world.",
